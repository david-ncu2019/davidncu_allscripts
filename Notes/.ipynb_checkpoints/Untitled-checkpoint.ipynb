    "### What You Need to Prepare\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the `gtwr` model, you need to prepare the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **A Formula**: A standard R formula that specifies your dependent and independent variables (e.g., `Y ~ X1 + X2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Spatial Data**: Your data must be in a spatial format. The `GWmodel` package accepts either a `Spatial*DataFrame` object (from the `sp` package) or an `sf` object. This object must contain the coordinates and the variables listed in your formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Time Stamps (`obs.tv`)**: You need a vector that contains the time stamp for each observation in your dataset. This can be a numeric vector (e.g., the year) or a date/time object (e.g., from `POSIXlt` or `Date` classes). The length of this vector must match the number of observations in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **A Spatio-Temporal Bandwidth (`st.bw`)**: This is a critical parameter that defines the extent of the local neighborhood in both space and time. It can be either:\n",
    "    * **A fixed distance**: All observations within this spatio-temporal distance of a regression point are used for the local calibration.\n",
    "    * **An adaptive number of neighbors**: The bandwidth expands or shrinks to include a fixed number of the nearest spatio-temporal neighbors.\n",
    "    You can determine an optimal bandwidth using the `bw.gtwr` function before running the main model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Kernel Function (`kernel`)**: You need to specify how distance translates into weight. Common choices include `\"gaussian\"`, `\"bisquare\"`, or `\"tricube\"`. If not specified, `\"bisquare\"` is used by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Spatio-Temporal Distance Parameters**: The model combines spatial and temporal distances. You may need to specify:\n",
    "    * `lamda`: A value between 0 and 1 that balances the influence of the spatial versus the temporal distance components.\n",
    "    * `ksi`: An adjustment parameter for the spatio-temporal distance calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Code Snippet Looks\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a conceptual code snippet demonstrating the workflow for running a GTWR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# 1. Load the GWmodel library\n",

    "# Replace 'longitude' and 'latitude' with your actual coordinate column names\n",
    "coords <- as.matrix(cbind(my_data$longitude, my_data$latitude))\n",
    "my_spdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords, my_data)\n",

    "time_stamps <- my_spdf$year\n",
    "\n",

    "formula <- Y ~ X1 + X2\n",

    "# 4. (Recommended) Select an optimal spatio-temporal bandwidth\n",

    "Based on a thorough review of the functions available in the `GWmodel` package, it is **not possible** to perform a multiscale GTWR \"out-of-the-box\" by simply combining existing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a detailed explanation of why and what would be required to build such a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Challenge: Incompatible Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental issue lies in the design philosophies of the two key functions, `gwr.multiscale()` and `gtwr()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`gwr.multiscale()` is fundamentally spatial.**\n",
    "    * Its core purpose is to find a separate, optimal **spatial bandwidth** for each variable.\n",
    "    * The back-fitting algorithm it uses is designed to call a spatial bandwidth selection function (`bw.gwr`) for each variable during its iterative process.\n",
    "    * It has no built-in parameters or logic to handle time stamps or spatio-temporal distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`gtwr()` is fundamentally single-scale.**\n",
    "    * Its purpose is to calibrate a model using a combined **spatio-temporal distance**, but it applies **one single bandwidth** to all variables in the model.\n",
    "    * The bandwidth selection function, `bw.gtwr()`, is designed to find this single optimal spatio-temporal bandwidth for the entire model, not for individual components.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot simply feed the output of one into the other. The `gwr.multiscale` function lacks the ability to understand or process the temporal data and spatio-temporal distance metrics that are essential for GTWR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Would Be Required to Build a Multiscale GTWR Program?\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a program to perform multiscale GTWR would require significant modifications and new code, effectively creating a new modeling function. You would need to merge the logic of both `gwr.multiscale` and `gtwr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the conceptual workflow that would need to be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a New Wrapper Function**: You would need to write a new top-level function, let's call it `gtwr.multiscale()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Combine Parameters**: This new function would need to accept the parameters from both worlds:\n",
    "    * From `gwr.multiscale`: `formula`, `data`, `criterion`, `max.iterations`, `threshold`, etc.\n",
    "    * From `gtwr`: `obs.tv` (the crucial time stamps), `lamda`, and `ksi` (for defining the spatio-temporal distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Adapt the Back-Fitting Algorithm**: The core back-fitting algorithm from `gwr.multiscale.R` would need to be re-written. The main change would be inside the iterative loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Current `gwr.multiscale` logic**:\n",
    "        ```R\n",
    "        # For each variable i:\n",
    "        # 1. Isolate the effect of variable i.\n",
    "        # 2. Call bw.gwr() to find the optimal SPATIAL bandwidth.\n",
    "        # 3. Update coefficients for variable i using the new spatial bandwidth.\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * **Required `gtwr.multiscale` logic**:\n",
    "        ```R\n",
    "        # For each variable i:\n",
    "        # 1. Isolate the effect of variable i.\n",
    "        # 2. Call bw.gtwr() to find the optimal SPATIO-TEMPORAL bandwidth.\n",
    "        # 3. Update coefficients for variable i using the new spatio-temporal bandwidth.\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Modify Bandwidth Selection Calls**: The line in the back-fitting algorithm that calls the bandwidth selector would need to be changed from `bw.gwr()` to `bw.gtwr()`, and all necessary spatio-temporal parameters (`obs.tv`, `lamda`, etc.) would have to be passed correctly at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the package provides the building blocks (spatio-temporal distance calculation and a back-fitting algorithm), they are not designed to work together for a multiscale GTWR model. Building this functionality would be a substantial development project, not a simple combination of existing functions."
