    "Of course. Understanding the output of a model is the most important part of the analysis. I'm happy to explain what each of those column names means in the context of your GTWR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of each column from your results file, explained in a step-by-step manner as you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation of GTWR Output Columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from the GTWR calibration gives you a rich set of information for each data point. We can group the columns into three categories: **1) Model Coefficients**, **2) Model Performance**, and **3) Location and Time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Model Coefficients and Their Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns describe the local regression model that was calibrated at each specific data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Intercept`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** This is the *local intercept* or baseline value.\n",
    "    * **In your context:** It represents the estimated value of your target variable, **`Layer_1`**, when the independent variable (`CUMDISP`) is zero, at that specific location and time. Since it's a *local* intercept, its value can change from one point to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `CUMDISP`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** This is the *local coefficient* for your independent variable, `CUMDISP`.\n",
    "    * **In your context:** This is a key output. It shows the strength and direction of the relationship between `CUMDISP` and `Layer_1` at each specific point. For example, if the value in this column is `1.5` for a particular point, it means that at that location, a 1-unit increase in `CUMDISP` is associated with a 1.5-unit increase in `Layer_1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Intercept_SE` and `CUMDISP_SE`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** These are the **Standard Errors** (SE) for the local intercept and the local `CUMDISP` coefficient, respectively.\n",
    "    * **How to interpret:** The Standard Error measures the precision or uncertainty of the coefficient estimate. A **smaller** SE indicates a more precise and reliable estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Intercept_TV` and `CUMDISP_TV`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** These are the **t-values** for the local intercept and the local `CUMDISP` coefficient. It is calculated as `(Coefficient / Standard Error)`.\n",
    "    * **How to interpret:** The t-value is used to assess the statistical significance of the local coefficients. A general rule of thumb is that an absolute t-value **greater than 1.96** suggests that the coefficient is statistically significant at a 95% confidence level (meaning it is unlikely to be zero). This is crucial for determining if the relationship between `CUMDISP` and `Layer_1` is meaningful at a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Model Performance and Diagnostics**\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns tell you how well the model performed at each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `y`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** This is the **original, observed value** of your dependent variable.\n",
    "    * **In your context:** This is the actual value from the `Layer_1` column in your input CSV file. It's the \"ground truth\" that the model is trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `yhat`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** This is the **predicted value** (or \"fitted\" value) generated by the GTWR model for each data point.\n",
    "    * **How to interpret:** You can compare `yhat` directly to `y`. The closer they are, the better the model's prediction was for that specific point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `residual`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** This is the model's error, calculated as `y - yhat` (observed value minus predicted value).\n",
    "    * **How to interpret:** A small residual (close to zero) means the model's prediction was very accurate for that point. A large positive residual means the model under-predicted the value, while a large negative residual means it over-predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Stud_residual`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** This is the **Studentized Residual**. It's a standardized version of the raw residual.\n",
    "    * **How to interpret:** This is very useful for identifying **outliers**. A general rule is that any data point with a Studentized Residual greater than +2.5 or less than -2.5 is a potential outlier where the model did not fit well.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Location and Time Identifiers**\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns provide the context for where and when each local model was calibrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `X_TWD97` and `Y_TWD97`\n",
    "    * **What they are:** These are the spatial coordinates for each data point, carried over directly from your input file. They define the **\"where\"** of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `time_stamp`\n",
    "    * **What it is:** This column indicates the time period for each observation.\n",
    "    * **In your context:** This column gets its value from the `monthly` column you specified in your `CONFIG`. The `gtwr` function renames it to `time_stamp` in the output. This defines the **\"when\"** of the analysis."
