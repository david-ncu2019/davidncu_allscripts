    "The ground-range resolution of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating in ScanSAR mode depends on several factors, including the radar's transmitted pulse characteristics, the geometry of the radar's imaging, and the platform's altitude. Here are the key dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bandwidth (B):** The primary factor that determines the range resolution in SAR is the bandwidth of the transmitted pulse. A higher bandwidth results in finer range resolution. The basic formula for range resolution (\\(\\delta R\\)) in the slant range is given by:\n",
